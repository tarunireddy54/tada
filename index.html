    <h2><p>My dear future husband how could you even think of you not being a priority to me ??
        you are my every thing sweetheart... i am not sure about having a brain dead case but im pretty sure 
        I would even survive cuz...its the way i am living even now with no brain and you filled in heart 
        too cool right?? ik 😎 i wish we stay long and hope every difficulty feels like just a bump on an 
        uneven road 🛣️ i love you soo soo much cutieee.... i love the way you handle my mood swings ... infact
        you dominate but is okay cuz even i get to dominate not often but sometimes... but it doesnt matter 
        cuz everything is fair in love i guess... its complete with war but you know it need not be mentioned cuz 
        it would just be like asking a army person who's been fighting all day long about the war 😝
        i dont know but it feels like you dint understand what i said but its okay some words are even more pretty
        when they are half understood.. but 
        the only thing i want to say is  I LOVE YOU  and can't wait to livelove laugh with you forever .. 
        I MISS YOU 😔
        anyways stay home (you won't do that) stay safe and 
        stay strong 🤗 <br>
